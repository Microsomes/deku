# Abstract

Fundamentally abstracting is about compressing, in general this defines the boundaries of concepts and more importantly define a name capable of describing them.

## How to find good abstractions?

### Negative

A classical way to introduce abstractions is to detect some negative behaviour where somethings looks like it is doing more than it was supposed to and then negatively abstracting this "weird behavior away".

A common questions is "what is this doing?".

## Positive

Another way to introduce abstractions it to try to find the name directly, by finding some structure already implicitly defined and then positevily lifting this structure into an explicitly defined one.

A common question is "what this describes?".
