(* This load-test measures the TPS capacity of Deku. To run it do: ./sandbox.sh
   tear-down ./sandbox.sh setup ./sandbox.sh deploy-dummy-ticket ./sandbox.sh
   start
   and in a new terminal do
   ./sandbox.sh load-test
   To test TPS, we create a large amount of "unit" transactions which transfer a
   dummy ticket from one hardcoded acount to another. These tickets do not
   contain data, and so performance will be different if change the tickets to a
   more representative kind. The load-test then spams these transactions to the
   nodes. We select the hash of the last generated transaction, and query the
   Deku state until we can see that the operation corresponding to our hash has
   appeared in Deku's applied blocks. At this point we select the first block
   where that hash appears (final block), select the block where we started
   spamming transactions (initial block), grab the sizes of the applied blocks
   in this range, and calculate the time difference between the initial and
   final block.
   Let: - I be the initial block - F be the final block - It be the timestamp of
   the initial block - Ft be the timestamp of the final block - let L be the
   length of the applied blocks
   Then TPS(I, F) = L / (Ft - It)
   Note that the load-test calculates the TPS offline using Deku data after it
   has been recorded, as opposed to Prometheus which calculates TPS on the fly
   by observing variables in Deku.
   There are 4 parameters we can pass to the load-test: - Round count - Batch
   count - Batch size - Wait time
   The amount of transactions we pass during the load-test is (Round count *
   Batch count * Batch size).
   The wait time is a tuning parameter that determines how long we wait before
   querying Deku about the applied blocks.
   Currently we have no way to provide load test parameters of the form e.g.
   send 1k transactions a second for 5 minutes. Instead our current tests look
   like e.g. send 50k transactions and tell me when they've all been processed.
   TODO: Tracking function runtime so we can run tests based on load rate
   instead of transaction count
   TODO: Do these numbers agree with prometheus *)
