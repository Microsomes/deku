# Deku

## Goals

- Simple, blockchains are developed by humans
- Stable, humans rely on blobkchains
- Fast, speed actually matters a lot of times
- Sound, people put money on blockchains

## Simple

For Deku the goal is to avoid whenever possible trade-offs that would make the other goals harder to achieve, this means that sometimes Deku will be exceptionally simple on its base.

## Stable
